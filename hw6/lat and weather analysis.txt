The data used for the analysis was collected during Dec 2018. This is one of the explanations for the high temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere. This is typically winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The graph of the Latitude compared to the average temperature would support this. If you can imagine the graph being converted to the round planet it would show how the sun is hitting certain parts of the Earth more during this time of year. The sun is always shining on the center and as the Northern Hemisphere tilts away the temperatures dip into freezing temperatures.

The humidity was a surprise. The data indicates the humidity travels in bands from North to South. At the time of the data it appeared that the humidity was between 60% and 100%. There appears to be slightly more humidity in the Northern Hemisphere. Again because it was winter this was a surprise for me to discover. I would have expected the air to be drier as well as colder.

The cloudiness analysis is not very conclusive to me. There appears to be very little cloud cover for most of the Earth during this time period. Also the cloud cover does not relate to the humidity.  

The wind speed also is not conclusive to me either. I see that there are mild winds for all the Earth but this would not be enough to move clouds away at a very fast pace. 

I am not a meteorologist but this information may be more insightful for the trained eye. I was only able to derive meaning from the humidity and temperature.
